## Intent Classification with Pre-Trained models
This repository contains a project for intent classification leveraging pre-trained language models.
The implement model is based on huggingface and pytorch libraries.
Part of the code is based on https://github.com/patil-suraj/exploring-T5/blob/master/t5_fine_tuning.ipynb.
